# ng-common

This library was generated with [Nx](https://nx.dev).

`ng-common` contains a single **Angular** service: `LocalStorageService` which provides the implementation for `persist` action on the `todosMachine`. This is just to show the `withConfig` capability of `xstate` for maximizing reusability of the State Machines.
