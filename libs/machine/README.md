# machine

This library was generated with [Nx](https://nx.dev).

`machine` contains two **State Machines**: `todosMachine` and `todoMachine`

1. `todosMachine`: This Machine controls the states of the `Todo` application as a whole: **Todo List** and **Filter**.
2. `todoMachine`: This Machine controls the states of each individual `Todo` item

These two machines are reused for both `Angular` and `React` apps in this workspace.
